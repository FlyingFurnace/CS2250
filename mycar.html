                        <p>It has a naturally aspirated K20Z3 engine which makes about 197hp and 139lb.ft of torque from the factory. It also revs all the way to 8000rpm.</p>
                        <p>My car is also equipped with a close-ratio six-speed manual transmisson with a limited slip differential that is very fun to drive.</p>
                        <p>It also has quite an uncommon color, Habanero Red Pearl, that shifts color depending on the lighting!</p>

                <h3>This is where 99% of my time and money goes (ha ha)</h3>
                <p>I purchased my car last year in an attempt to familiarize myself with working on and modding cars as well as become proficient in driving manual.</p>
                <h3>So what made you choose this car?</h3>
                <p>It was cheap, probably because it was kind of broken. Also, it has very high mileage. It still rips though.</p>
                <p>Because I devote most of my free time to researching and finding out what is wrong with my car and how to fix it, it's mostly sorted out and completely driveable at this point.</p>
                <h3>What in particular have you fixed?</h3>
                <p>Many things. Here's a table to detail everything I've worked on:</p>
